## Asteroid Shooter - Unreal Engine C++
My First Unreal Engine C++ project, a space shooter where you control a spaceship and destroy asteroids in space.

# Features
- Custom C++ Player Pawn with shooting Mechanics
- Three Main Levels that get increasingly Difficult
- Time trial mode with basic procedural astreroid spawning.
- Basic UI systems, including Menus and HUD.

# What I Learned 
This project taught me the fundementals of Unreal Engine C++ development
- Creating custom pawn and handling input with the enhanced input system
- Implementing projectile systems and collision detection through the use of dynamic delegates
- Spawning actors dynamically during runtime
- Level design and gamemode setup

# Details 
- Engine: Unreal Engine 5.6
- Language: C++
- Platform: Windows

# Future Improvements
- Power-ups
- Leaderboard for Time-trial
- More complex asteroid spawning
